### logs

- 2022.04.03 still on going [build portfolio web html& css to react](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4P7aS4PuSw&t=3225s)
  - focus on : portfolio.css, header.js, 
    - how to handle html (btn, query selector, classList)
    - how to handle css (root-alias, toggle btn, dark mode, rem, responsive)

- 2022.04.14 About part started, 1:13:19
  - focus on : ... include img, this time in html
  - problem is : in react, including images very limited in src&routes. only can call the items from src or modules.
    - react icons are still powerful, but we do need more - custom images, blablabla.
    - or fully opened web dev, we may use cdn. but in this case, it is not.

- 2022.04.24 : need to rewind ~1:34:00,
  - npm broken :p
    - trying to change the node v14 to v16, but it crashed as well

  - so make new proj with node 18! >> temp-setup
